this is the advanced sow mod i intend to make for aground, however, it has been abandoned for the time being and likely will be for a while

# lore

alchemist detects other worldly magical spike
makes a detector with some materials
we descend into a ruined world
after some exploring we meet a lone ardoni
area around his hiding spot is littered with spirit blocks
he greets you and asks you to scavenge some materials and food and a strange material that will later be known as ardoni essence
(enemies exist the whole time)
a side quest is he asks for some special food if you've seen a pizza and he asks for one but it is hidden till you get one in inv
after getting his strength back he asks for some materials to make a song crafter(one of the only ways to get songs here, unlike  my last mod)
he then gives you some materials to create a forcefield breaker, which breaks the forcefield hiding the things beyond the current island from view
after that he tells you that certain enemies there have mastered physical warfare so much they can only be hurt by songs(might need extensive haxe)
you beat them, and certain puzzle pieces are dropped by each one(if unrenewable, make them zero weight)
by these puzzle pieces, a portal is formed which lets you go to different worlds and a different starsystem
the original ardoni also makes a ship for you, with some of the ardoni you free while fighting bosses, and gives you a special card
if you manage to find out how to change jumpcost, let the original ardoni give a recipe for a new item to use as jumpcost for this new system, if it's only navigatable by this and similar ships 
you first can go to an ardoni safe haven, made to protect them from the ongoing war
they question you and let you go when you show them a card given to you by the lone ardoni to prove you mean no harm
